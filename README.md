# C-Keylogger
This C# Keylogger will create a log file in the "My Documents" folder and will continuously log keystrokes while the program is running. Every 30 minutes, it will send the keystrokes to the Discord webhook as a message. Make sure to replace "INSERT YOUR DISCORD WEBHOOK URL HERE" with the actual webhook URL you want to use.
