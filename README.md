# C-Sharp Keylogger
The C# Keylogger will create a log file in the "My Documents" folder and will continuously log keystrokes while the program is running. Every 30 minutes, it will send the keystrokes to the Discord webhook as a message. Make sure to replace "INSERT YOUR DISCORD WEBHOOK URL HERE" with the actual webhook URL you want to use. 

#Python Keylogger
The Python Keylogger will create a log file called "keylogs.txt", then it will upload the keystrokes to pastebin. Remember to replace YOUR_PASTEBIN_API_KEY_HERE with your actual Pastebin API key.
